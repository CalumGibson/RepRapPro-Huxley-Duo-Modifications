# RepRapPro-Huxley-Duo-Modifications
The modifications to the standard RepRapPro components allow for broken versions of the original components to be more easily replaced in much less time.  Each clamp component is split into a corresponding male and female section which click together, locking in place.  The z-motor bracket is split into two sections so that if the component cracks in the clamping region, the end section can easily be replaced.
